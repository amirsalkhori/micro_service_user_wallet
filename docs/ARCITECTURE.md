# Software Architecture
The application is developed using Symfony framework as REST API.

Application is separated into several parts:
- Controllers go inside the `app\src\Controllers`
- Services go inside the `app\src\Services`
- Migrations go inside the `app\migrations`
- Documents go inside the `docs`
- Routes go inside the `Inside the controller`
- Tests go inside the `tests`
